# Javascript weather app
A simple weather web app which will tell you what is the weather like in your location by default by using browser geolocation, or show you some other place's weather by searching it's name using the input box.
## Resources
This weather app uses two free APIs:\
<ul>
<li>[Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/). To get searched place's coordinates.</li>
<li>[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/). To look up place's weather.</li>
</ul>
